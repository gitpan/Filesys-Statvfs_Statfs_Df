Revision history for Perl extension Filesys::Statfs Filesys::Statvfs Filesys::Df

0.01  Thur Mar 11 23:26:11 2004
	- I created this package that includes all three modules.
	  I made a bunch of changes to Filesys::Statfs. Right now it only
          works with Darwin and BSD. These are the only two Unix OSes without statvfs()
	  that I could find.

0.70  Fri Sep 3 20:26:11 2004
	- Updated the Makefile.PL to check and see if the statvfs header and statfs
	  header exist. If I cant find them in the include path I default to the 
	  previous behavior.
