Revision history for Perl extension Filesys::Statfs Filesys::Statvfs Filesys::Df

0.01  Thur Mar 11 23:26:11 2004
	- I created this package that includes all three modules.
	  I made a bunch of changes to Filesys::Statfs. Right now it only
          works with Darwin and BSD. These are the only two Unix OSes without statvfs()
	  that I could find.

0.70  Fri Sep 3 20:26:11 2004
	- Updated the Makefile.PL to check and see if the statvfs header and statfs
	  header exist. If I cant find them in the include path I default to the 
	  previous behavior.

0.71  Fri Sep 24 18:19:42 2004
	- Changed Makefile.PL to define a new value for Darwin and BSD systems if
	  no statfs or statvfs headers are found. In the future if either of these 
	  systems use those headers instead of mount.h and param.h no changes should
	  be required.

	- Removed HP-UX specific values that are returned from statvfs().

	- Changed some of the text in the documentation and Makefile.PL.

	- Added DISTNAME and now cleanup config.h in Makefile.PL.

0.72  Tues Feb 8 23:19:42 2005
	- Fixed bug where large filesystems(1+ terabyte), that would use
 	  all 32bits in the blocks field, would report incorrect values.
	  The xs files now check whether the values should be pushed on the
	  stack as signed or unsigned.

0.73  Tues Feb 18 14:10:42 2005
	- Added some extra error checking.

0.75  Tues Mar 6 15:43:42 2005
	- Changed signed test.
	- Found out that pre 5.6.0 doesnt support newSVuv(). Added checks in xs code
	 for 5.6.0.

0.77  Thur June 30 19:48:42 2005
	- Added XSPROTOARG to Makefile.PL to suppress compiler warning.
	- Changed makefile to always create Df.pm and test.pl instead of having them 
 	  by default point to statvfs(). This doesn't change the functionality of 
	  the module at all. It just makes it a little easier to maintain.
